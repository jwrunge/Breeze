# General
First, thank you for taking the time to look at my work! I've enjoyed putting this project together and am looking forward to talking with you more soon.
Just some general information:
* This project was created with Lumen. I typically work with Laravel, but I wasn't so sure Laravel was small enough!
* Most of the files I worked with are in the resources/views directory, the database/migrations directory, the two model files in App/, and the controller in App/Http/Controllers. I also configured web routes in routes/web.php.
* If you download locally, you can install all dependencies with `composer install`
* I'll be uploading sample data .CSVs into the root directory shortly
* I'll have a working app online at a temporary server later this afternoon if you want to try it out without cloning
